In this work, after presenting the methodology and the results of a finite element solver for the Helmholtz Impedance problem and showing its limits in high wave numbers, a framework for solving this problem with variational physics-informed neural networks is presented and implemented. Using this framework, different aspects have been investigated in order to understand the behavior of this kind of solvers for the Helmholtz Impedance problem. The behavior of the network with different architectures and different number of test functions is examined and it has been concluded that the best approach for reinforcing the network is to increase the number of hidden layers and to scale the number of test functions with the square root of the number of the parameters of the network. It has been shown that a coercive variational formulation with suitable test functions could be beneficial for high wave numbers, and it has been observed that a least-squares based initialization method could effectively facilitate the training. Some ideas for future works are suggested at the end of the report.
